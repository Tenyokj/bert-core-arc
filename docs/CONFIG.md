## Configuration Philosophy

BERT configuration is not cosmetic. Parameter changes affect:
- spam resistance
- round cadence
- voter friction
- author participation cost
- treasury distribution behavior
- reviewer workload
- reserve accumulation

Configuration should therefore be treated as part of protocol policy, not only as deployment setup.

## Voting Parameters

### `IDEAS_PER_ROUND`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- how many ideas are batched into a single round

Higher values:
- increase round density
- increase comparison complexity for voters
- increase gas and state-processing load during round creation and resolution

Lower values:
- create narrower rounds
- reduce cognitive load
- may slow broad protocol throughput if too many rounds are required

Operational note:
- if set too high relative to proposal supply, rounds can become harder to reason about
- if set too low, the system may fragment capital signaling across too many small rounds
- the contract enforces `5 <= IDEAS_PER_ROUND <= 50`; default policy is `30`

### `VOTING_DURATION`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- how long a round stays open for voting

Higher values:
- give more time for coordination and discovery
- slow funding cadence
- keep capital in unresolved state longer

Lower values:
- speed treasury decisions
- increase the risk of low-participation or rushed rounds

### `minStake`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- minimum token amount required to cast a vote

Higher values:
- reduce low-signal or spam voting
- increase voter friction
- may shrink total voter participation

Lower values:
- improve accessibility
- increase noise and potential low-conviction participation

### `humanOnlyVoting`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- whether voting is restricted to wallets that pass the configured verified-human policy

When enabled:
- lowers sybil exposure
- adds integration dependency on an external verifier
- increases participation quality at the cost of some UX friction

Operational note:
- do not enable this without configuring `humanVerifier`

### `humanVerifier`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- external verifier contract that decides whether a wallet is allowed to vote as a verified human

Operational note:
- this should remain provider-agnostic at the protocol layer
- the verifier can be backed by proof-of-personhood, privacy-preserving identity checks, or stronger compliance flows
- in the current PoP deployment model, the verifier stores attestations signed by a trusted backend signer after offchain human verification succeeds
- operators must keep the trusted signer and backend environment aligned

### `maxVoteAmount`
Owned by:
- `VotingSystemUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- maximum amount a single wallet can commit in one vote

Higher values:
- preserve capital expression for large voters
- weaken anti-whale protection

Lower values:
- reduce single-wallet influence
- can push large participants to split capital if identity gating is weak

Operational note:
- this works best together with verified-human gating, not by itself
- current live policy target:
  `humanOnlyVoting = true`
  `maxVoteAmount = 10_000 * 10^6`

## Proposal Intake Parameters

### `authorMinStake`
Owned by:
- `IdeaRegistryUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- minimum author stake required to create an idea

Higher values:
- increase anti-spam protection
- create stronger economic commitment from builders
- can exclude smaller or newer builders

Lower values:
- improve accessibility for idea creation
- weaken spam resistance
- reduce the economic significance of rejected-stake slashing

Operational note:
- this parameter directly shapes the quality-vs-accessibility tradeoff of the intake layer

## Grant Release Parameters

### `minimumNetFundingByIdea`
Owned by:
- `IdeaRegistryUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- the minimum USDC amount a proposal must receive after the round's snapshotted pledge fee for it to be eligible to win

Why it matters:
- prevents a proposal from becoming a live grant with insufficient capital for its disclosed scope
- lets a higher-vote but underfunded proposal be skipped in favor of the highest viable alternative
- makes the funding threshold visible before a participant pledges

Operational note:
- this is provided by the author at proposal creation and is not an admin override after votes arrive
- the check uses net funding after the fee snapshotted for that round

### `pledgeFeeBps`
Owned by:
- `FundingPoolUpgradeable`

Meaning:
- successful-round protocol fee in basis points, charged only to a winning pledge that becomes a live grant

Bounds and behavior:
- default: `500` basis points, or `5%`
- maximum: `1,000` basis points, or `10%`
- each round snapshots the value when opened, so later changes cannot alter an in-progress round
- losing pledges and a winner that never claims are refunded in full
- the fee becomes protocol reserve only after `claimGrant` succeeds

### Grant and Review Deadlines
Owned by:
- `GrantManagerUpgradeable` constants

Current policy:
- claim a settled winning grant within `14 days`
- submit stage-one proof within `45 days` after the initial payout
- submit stage-two proof within `60 days` after the stage-one payout
- reviewers have `14 days` to resolve an active proof request
- a rejected proof has a `48 hour` resubmission cooldown

If a deadline is missed, the permissionless expiry path protects pledge capital according to the round state: a never-claimed winner restores its full gross pledge; an incomplete live grant exposes its remaining net pledge to pro-rata refund by winning pledgers.

### Milestone Thresholds and Cooldowns
Some milestone review logic is embedded as protocol behavior rather than a general open parameter surface.

Operators should still understand:
- approval thresholds
- reviewer participation caps
- rejection cooldown behavior

These values affect:
- reviewer throughput
- payout latency
- proof spam resistance

## Treasury and Token Configuration

### Funding Token Address
Owned by:
- treasury and deployment wiring

Meaning:
- the ERC-20 asset used for voting capital, author stake, and payout accounting

Risk if wrong:
- idea creation fails
- vote commitment fails
- treasury reads become meaningless
- payout behavior becomes invalid

### Reserve Behavior
The protocol reserve is not just a number; it is a policy-backed capital bucket.

Operators should understand:
- rejected author stakes can move into reserve
- a successful-round fee moves into reserve only after the winning author claims
- refundable pledges remain outside protocol reserve until their owner claims them
- reserve allocation is a separate admin action and must never be used to replace a proposal's pledged funding target

## Role and Dependency Wiring

Correct dependency wiring is just as important as numeric parameters.

Critical addresses include:
- funding pool
- idea registry
- voting system
- grant manager
- reputation system
- voter progression
- roles registry

Critical role assignments include:
- `VOTING_ROLE`
- `GRANT_ROLE`
- `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE`
- `IREGISTRY_ROLE`
- `REPUTATION_MANAGER_ROLE`
- `AUTO_GRANT_ROLE`

If addresses or roles are wrong, valid code may still fail at runtime.

## Recommended Defaults

For local or staging-style testing, existing protocol defaults have included:
- `IDEAS_PER_ROUND = 30`
- `VOTING_DURATION = 1 day`
- `minStake = 10 * 10^6`
- `authorMinStake = 50 * 10^6`
- `pledgeFeeBps = 500`
- `minimumNetFunding` is proposal-specific and must be set by the author

Current Arc testnet governance policy as of August 18, 2026:
- `humanOnlyVoting = true`
- `maxVoteAmount = 10_000 * 10^6`
- `trustedSigner` must match the PoP backend signer address exactly

These should be treated as environment defaults, not universal policy truths.

## Change Management Guidance

Before changing any major parameter:
1. identify the economic goal of the change
2. identify the UX effect
3. identify the security or trust effect
4. rehearse the new configuration in a test environment
5. record the old and new values
6. validate dependent flows after the change

Recommended practice:
- test locally first
- test on Sepolia or equivalent staging next
- document parameter intent in `CHANGELOG.md`
- re-run post-change checks for voting, idea creation, and grant release
